# Advent of Code

I discovered "Advent of Code" in 2023 but, at that time, I only watched some people on YouTube try to solve the puzzles in [Rust](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWtPciJ1UMuD3_8Pb-EqrFhkYpastR2cn&si=867OYl3nPSXMPo09). I will give it a crack in 2024 using Python (because it's the main language that I know) but hopefully this becomes a yearly tradition that I can use to experiment with new languages in the future.
